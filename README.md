# Challenge 3

This report takes closing prices from Bitstamp and Coinbase from the first quarter of 2018, and ultimately overlays them to see if there's any arbitrage opportunities between the two exchanges. Throughout the report, plot charts of various characteristics will be seen to illustrate some of the data found for easier viewing and understanding.

## Further Summary

We were asked to pick a date early, middle, and late from the dataset generated. I chose January 28, 2018 as my early date because I noticed on the overlay of the Bitstamp and Coinbase datasets that there was a large spread change. I wanted to examine that. As the quarter progressed, the spread change diminished, and that is evidential in the blank charts and lack of numbers when calling certain data.
