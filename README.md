This report takes closing prices from Bitstamp and Coinbase from the first quarter of 2018, and ultimately overlays them to see if there's any arbitrage opportunities between the two exchanges. Throughout the report, plot charts of various characteristics will be seen to illustrate some of the data found for easier viewing and understanding.
